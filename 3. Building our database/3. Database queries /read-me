     print(projectObj)
     print(projectObj.title)
     print(projectObj.created)

     projects1 = Project.objects.filter(title__startswith = 'Te')
     print(projects1)

     projects2 = Project.objects.filter(vote_ratio__gte = 1)     #Here gte is greater than equal to

2.     # Query Models Children using set (query to get children of model)  (for One to many relationship)
        projectObj = Project.objects.get(title = 'Test')
        print(projectObj.reviews_set.all())

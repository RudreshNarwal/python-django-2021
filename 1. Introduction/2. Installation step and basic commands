We will install virtualenv 

VirtualEnv --> Instead of installing django globally, we will install vitualenv and create virtualenv and 
            will install django in that environment. This is done because some of your project might be dependent on
            django outdated verison and some are compatible with latest env. This will be managed in virtual environment


Create virtual environment --> vitualenv <env name>

Start and activate virtual environment -->  . <env name>/bin/activate.fish

Deactivate environment -->  . <env name>/bin/deactivate.fish

Installing django --> pip install django

List of command in django --> django-admin

Create a project --> django-admin startproject <project name>

start sevrver --> pyhton3 manage.py runserver


**** Move your env folder in your project folder--> This will help you in recognizing which project use which env ****

start project ---> python3 manage.py startapp <project name>  (refer structure.png --> we will have multiple apps) like projects 
// goto djangocourse settings.py and add app in Installed Apps list
